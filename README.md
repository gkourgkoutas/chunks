# chunks
Sometimes while pivoting, copy/pasting large scripts from GitHub don't work because of weird clipboard size behavior from the programs we use (had some weird issues with guacamole recently). To avoid frustration and counter copy/paste issues, small chunks of the original script should be sufficient.

# Contribution
Feel free to contribute. If you want to add a desired script, please use the following format for chunk files:

[original-scriptname]-XX.[extension]

**Example**:

- SharpHound-aa.ps1
- SharpHound-ab.ps1
- ...
- SharpHound-ZZ.ps1

Numbers (-01,-02, etc.) could be used, but I like to avoid sorting issues on different OS's, that's why it's kept alphabetical.
